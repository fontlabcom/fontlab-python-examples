# Work record

2026-10-14: Added the user's complete PythonQt example-port request to the root
and repository plans/task lists. Both supplied URLs identify pyqt/examples.
Read upstream README directly: numbered examples and official demos are included;
different license terms and current PyQt6 imports require per-file review and
Qt5/PythonQt adaptation. No source acquisition, port or native acceptance claimed.

2026-10-14: User extended the task to eyllanesc/QtExamples. Root and repository
plans now include both complete repositories, with the repeated pyqt URL counted
once. Checked upstream README/GitHub metadata: QtExamples includes official and
additional entries and declares GPL-3.0. Native verification remains pending.

2026-10-14: Complete acquisition and inventory supersede the historical acquisition
status above. Both recovery receipts now verify all 1,569 original bytes against
their pinned Git blobs and retain immutable archive hashes, per-file SHA-256 and
logical-to-storage paths. The verified mapping preserves QtExamples' case-distinct
`others/matplotlib/Subplot.py` and `subplot.py`; original archives remain unchanged.

Added the stdlib receipt-driven inventory tool and checked-in complete catalog.
Verified totals: pyqt/examples 805 files / 308 Python, QtExamples 764 / 157;
all 465 Python files parse. Static source evidence identifies 298 Python launch
candidates, 14 ambiguous Python candidates, 153 helpers and 3 uncertain QML
launcher candidates. All 1,569 files retain unique source/target identities;
69 shared or repository files have unresolved ownership. Resource/API/import
evidence and byte duplicate groups retain complete denominators. All license
reviews remain pending, including 43 files with no recognized declaration.

Verification: `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 uv run --no-project --with pytest
--with pytest-cov python -m pytest -p pytest_cov -q tests --cov=tools
--cov-report=term-missing` passed 19 tests (86% tools coverage). Scoped Ruff lint
and formatting checks passed. Rebuilding from both verified roots into a clean
temporary directory yielded byte-identical JSON and Markdown. Exact source
recovery evidence is in the private `examples-upstream-trees.json` and
`examples-source-recovery.json` receipts; generated public output contains no
private absolute paths. No Qt, corpus example, fonts or settings were loaded.

All example implementations remain pending and all native states unexecuted.
Inventory coverage does not complete either collection's PythonQt ports.
